```

**Explanation:**

The files that need to be changed are:

* `src/prime_factors/primes.py`: Lines 1 and 2 need to be changed to implement the prime factorization algorithm.
* `tests/main_test.py`: Lines 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, and 21 need to be changed to test the newly implemented prime factorization algorithm.
