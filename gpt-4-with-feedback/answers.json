    "question": "Can you provide more details on how the generate function should behave? For example, what output do you expect when different values are input?",
    "answer": "The generate function should calculate the prime factors of a given integer 'n'. The function should return a list of the prime factors in ascending order. From your tests, it seems you expect the following behavior:\n- For n=1, output should be [], since 1 has no prime factors.\n- For prime numbers like 2, 3, 5, and 7, the output should be a list containing the number itself.\n- For composite numbers like 4 (2x2), 6 (2x3), 8 (2x2x2), and 1773 (3x3x197), the output should be a list of the prime numbers that multiply to n, including repeats if necessary."
